The following data are taken from Higgins and Koch (1977). The data come from
an extensive survey of workers in the cotton industry. The variable of interest is
the presence of lung byssinosis. Byssinosis, also called brown lung disease, is a
chronic, asthma-like narrowing of the airways resulting from inhaling particles of
cotton, flax, hemp, or jute. It has been recognized as an occupational hazard for
textile workers. More than 35,000 textile workers, mostly from textile-producing
regions of North and South Carolina, have been disabled by byssinosis, and 183
have died between 1979 and 1992.

Numbers of workers suffering from (yes) and not suffering from (no) byssinosis
for different categories of workers are given below. The covariates are race
(1, white; 2, other); gender (1, male; 2, female); smoking history (1, smoker;
2, nonsmoker); length of employment in the cotton industry (1, less than 10 years;
2, between 10 and 20 years; 3, more than 20 years); and the dustiness of the
workplace (1, high; 2, medium; 3, low).

The information can be arranged as a factorial, with the number of
affected workers among the total number of workers in each group as the
response variable. The 72 groups of the factorial arrangement are formed by
all possible level combinations of the five explanatory variables: 3(Dust) ×
2(Race) × 2(Sex) × 2(Smoking) × 3(Employment). Seven of the 72 categories
are empty. A subset of the data is shown below. The data, arranged as outcomes
(1 = YES and 0 = NO) and their frequencies (Weights), are given in the file
byssinosisWeights.csv.
